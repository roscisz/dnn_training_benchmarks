# Examples
We have chosen two applications as our subject of research and testing. 

* Deepspeech - an open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques, based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper. 
* Tensor2Tensor - a library of deep learning models and datasets designed to make deep learning more accessible and accelerate ML research. 

We've tested their performance and ease of use natively and using provided scripts, docker, and kubernetes. When Tensorhive will allow for deploying distributed trainings we will compare those results with our solution. Our general thoughts and tests results from kubernetes can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/PiotrowskiD/1e3f659a8ac7db1c2ca02ba0ae5fcfaf). Benchmark results, useful resources and more info about configuration and running examples can be found in corresponding folders.
