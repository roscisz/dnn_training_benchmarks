# Examples
This directory contains examples of deep neural network training applications that serve as
requirement providers towards TensorHive. We are testing their performance and ease of use depending
on computing resource management software used. This allows us to learn about various features of
existing resource management systems and base our design decisions on the experiences with approaches
such as native application execution, application-specific scripts, Docker and 
[Kubernetes](https://gist.github.com/PiotrowskiD/1e3f659a8ac7db1c2ca02ba0ae5fcfaf).  

The applications can be also useful for others as benchmarks. Our benchmark results, useful resources
and more info about configuration and running examples can be found in corresponding folders.
We plan to add TensorHive usage examples to the individual directories when distributed training deployment
is supported by TensorHive
